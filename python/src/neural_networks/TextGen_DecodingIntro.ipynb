    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been an increased interest in language generation due to the rise of transformer-based language models trained on millions of webpages, such as OpenAI's famous [GPT2 model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The results on conditioned open-ended language generation are quite good, e.g. [GPT2 on unicorns](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#samples), [XLNet](https://medium.com/@amanrusia/xlnet-speaks-comparison-to-gpt-2-ea1a4e9ba39e), [XLNet @ GitHub](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the improved transformer architecture and massive unsupervised training data, **better decoding methods** have also played an important role.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an intro to some of the decoding methods used for text generation. The notebook gives a brief overview of different decoding strategies and shows how to implement them with very little effort using the popular [Huggin Face Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook briefly mentions the more general topic known as [auto-regressive language generation](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, **auto-regressive** language generation is based on the assumption that the probability distribution of a word sequence can be decomposed into the product of conditional next word distributions as in the formula below. Note that the formula is remarkably similar to the **autoregressive** [formulation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SB1fYiOAzDqZS_NSjb7zONKqdGS-vkXB5g_5eE8dt_0/edit#slide=id.g1ec32d6190d_0_137) we used for **RNNs** :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(w_{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod_{t=1}^T P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_0) \\text{ ,with }  w_{1: 0} = \\emptyset, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_0$ is the initial *context* word sequence. The length $T$ of the word sequence is usually determined *on-the-fly* and corresponds to the timestep $t=T$ the EOS token is generated from $P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_{0})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-regressive language generation is available for `GPT2`, `XLNet`, `OpenAi-GPT`, `CTRL`, `TransfoXL`, `XLM`, `Bart`, `T5` in both PyTorch 2.5+ and TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we visit the following decoding methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Greedy search*\n",
    "2. *Beam search*\n",
    "3. *Sampling*\n",
    "4. *Top-K sampling*\n",
    "5. *Top-p sampling*."

    "### **Greedy Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy search selects the word with the highest probability as its next word: $w_t = argmax_{w}P(w | w_{1:t-1})$ at each timestep $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows how greedy search navigates through sentence trellis\n",
    "\n",
    "![Greedy Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/greedy_search.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the word **\"The\"**, greedy search chooses the next word with the highest probability **\"nice\"** and so on, until it reaches the last  word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the search is complete, the sequence is **\"The\", \"nice\", \"woman\"** with an overall probability of $0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections we will generate word sequences using **HF GPT2**  with the input text as context **( \"I\", \"enjoy\", \"walking\", \"with\", \"my\", \"cute\", \"dog\")**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also see how different encoding and serach methods can be used with **HF Transformers**\n",
